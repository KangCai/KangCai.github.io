Programming is a powerful and ubiquitous problem-solving tool. Developing systems that can assist programmers or even generate programs independently could make programming more productive and accessible, yet so far incorporating innovations in AI has proven challenging. Recent large-scale language models have demonstrated an impressive ability to generate code, and are now able to complete simple programming tasks. However, these models still perform poorly when evaluated on more complex, unseen problems that require problem-solving skills beyond simply translating instructions into code. For example, competitive programming problems which require an understanding of algorithms and complex natural language remain extremely challenging. To address this gap, we introduce AlphaCode, a system for code generation that can create novel solutions to these problems that require deeper reasoning. Evaluated on recent programming competitions on the Codeforces platform, AlphaCode achieved on average a ranking of top 54.3% in programming competitions with more than 5,000 participants. We found that three key components were critical to achieve good and reliable performance: (1) an extensive and clean competitive programming dataset for training and evaluation, (2) large and efficient-to-sample transformer-based architectures, and (3) large-scale model sampling to explore the search space, followed by filtering based on program behavior to a small set of submissions.

编程是一种强大而普遍的解决问题的工具。开发可以帮助程序员甚至独立生成程序的系统，可以提高编程的效率和可访问性，但迄今为止，在人工智能中整合创新被证明是具有挑战性的。最近的大规模语言模型已经展示了令人印象深刻的生成代码的能力，并且现在能够完成简单的编程任务。然而，当在更复杂、不可见的问题上评估时，这些模型的性能仍然很差，这些问题除了简单地将指令翻译成代码外，还需要解决问题的技能。例如，需要理解算法和复杂自然语言的竞争性编程问题仍然极具挑战性。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了AlphaCode，这是一种用于代码生成的系统，可以为这些需要更深入推理的问题创建新的解决方案。在Codeforces平台最近的编程竞赛中，AlphaCode 在5,000多人参加的编程竞赛中平均排名前54.3%。我们发现有三个关键部件是实现良好和可靠性能的关键:(1)一个广泛和干净的竞争性编程数据集用于训练和评估，(2)大型和高效采样的基于 transformer 的架构，(3)大规模模型采样以探索搜索空间，然后根据程序行为对一个小的提交集进行过滤。
