In the multibet card color game, a deck of 52 playing cards is shuffled. and placed
face-down on a table You can bet on the color of the top card at even odds. After
you have placed your bet, the top card is revealed to you and discarded. Betting
continues till the deck is exhausted. You begin with $1. If you can bet arbitrary
fractions of your bankroll, there is a simple strategy which guarantees you will win,
regardless of the order in which the cards appear, 2^52 / (52 26)\<: 9.08132955.This is
the maximum amount that you can guarantee that you will win. (A proof of this sketched at the end of the solution.) In this problem we want to find the maximumamount you can guarantee that you will win when you can bet in penny increments.
